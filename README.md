# YouTube-Data-SQL-MongoDB-Streamlit
## Objective :
 To create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The application should have the following features:
  
  
- Ability to input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve all the relevant data (Channel name, subscribers, total video count, playlist ID, video ID, likes, dislikes,   comments of each video) using Google API.
- Option to store the data in a MongoDB database as a data lake.
- Ability to collect data for up to 10 different YouTube channels and store them in the data lake by clicking a button.
- Option to select a channel name and migrate its data from the data lake to a SQL database as tables.
- Ability to search and retrieve data from the SQL database using different search options, including joining tables to get channel details.


## Expected Results : 
This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a MongoDB database, migrates it to a SQL data warehouse, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.

## Some potential benefits of this system may include: 
### Improved uptime :
By monitoring the status of the EC2 instances and being alerted when any of them go down, you can take action to restore service as quickly as possible. 
### Increased visibility:
The Prometheus server and exporters will collect a wide range of metrics about the performance and health of the EC2 instances, which can help you identify trends and issues that may not be immediately apparent. 
### Enhanced collaboration:
By sending alerts to a Slack channel, you can make it easier for team members to stay informed about the status of the EC2 instances and collaborate on resolving any issues that arise. 
### Overall, the result of this system should be a more reliable, transparent, and collaborative way to manage the EC2 instances in your environment.
